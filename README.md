# ReactPortfolio
## Initial version
This app shows my React Portfolio of work samples. WHEN I load the portfolio, I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. WHEN I view the header, I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. WHEN I view the navigation titles, I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section, I see titled images of four (not six) of the developerâ€™s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories

## Future improvements
Title corresponding to the current section will be highlighted later. I am aware about it I tried to make it work. I know styles could be set up brighter maybe, or more fancy. I plan to improve before the course is over. And I have just two links in the footer to LinkedIn and Github. I do not have twitter account and do not plan to have to add it to footer. I believe I meet all technical requirements.
