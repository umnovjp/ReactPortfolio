# ReactPortfolio
## Initial version
This app shows my React Portfolio of work samples. WHEN I load the portfolio, I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. WHEN I view the header, I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio. WHEN I view the navigation titles, I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.
## Future improvements
Title corresponding to the current section will be highlighted later. I know styles do not work correctly yet. And I have just two links in the footer to LinkedIn and Github. I do not have twitter account and do not plan to have.
